---- Text: This company has turned from bad to worse. I had made a purchase before. I had to return a few items at my own expense on top of that my money was not returned to me as my original payment. It was given to me in a fashion Nova gift card. Leaving my money stuck on this store where items and sizes are not super or great. Many items can be found at Shein for way cheaper.

---- Text: I don‚Äôt know if my new iPhone 14 is a refurbished phone or a brand new iPhone, the phone is like new, not a scratch or anything, it looks spanking new, and the best part was the price I paid for the iPhone, its unbelievable. I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy to the iPhone 14, my only problem is getting to learn the different features on the phone but, for the most part the phone is on point, works like a million dollar, looks like a million dollar. This will be my go to place to buy phones and apple watch, my next purchase will be a Apple Watch.
